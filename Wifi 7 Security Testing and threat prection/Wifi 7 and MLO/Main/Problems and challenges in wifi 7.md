The development of Wi-Fi 7 is not without its challenges. The papers highlight several open issues that need to be addressed:

- **Spectrum Fragmentation**: The use of wider and non-contiguous channels can lead to spectrum fragmentation, which needs to be managed effectively.
    
- **CSI Feedback Overhead**: As the number of antennas and spatial streams increases, the overhead associated with CSI feedback becomes a significant problem.
    
- **Multi-AP Synchronization**: Multi-AP coordination techniques require tight time and frequency synchronization between APs, which can be difficult to achieve in real-world deployments.
    
- **HARQ Implementation**: The implementation of HARQ in a Wi-Fi-like system raises several questions, including the granularity of retransmissions (e.g., at the packet or codeword level) and how to best integrate it with the existing MAC protocol
