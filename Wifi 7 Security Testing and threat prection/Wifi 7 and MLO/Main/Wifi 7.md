The next generation of Wi-Fi, known as **Wi-Fi 7** or **IEEE 802.11be Extremely High Throughput (EHT)**, is currently under development to meet the demands of future high-throughput and low-latency applications. These applications include 4k/8k video streaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), online gaming, and cloud computing. The goal of Wi-Fi 7 is to support a maximum throughput of at least 30 Gbps, and some projections suggest it could reach over 40 Gbps. It will operate in the 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz frequency bands while ensuring backward compatibility with older Wi-Fi devices.

### **Key PHY Layer Enhancements**

The physical (PHY) layer is a major focus of Wi-Fi 7, with several key enhancements being introduced to boost data rates and efficiency.

- **Expanded Bandwidth**: To achieve higher throughput, Wi-Fi 7 will support wider channel bandwidths, including contiguous 240 MHz and 320 MHz channels, as well as non-contiguous 160+80 MHz and 160+160 MHz channels. This is a significant increase from the 160 MHz maximum in Wi-Fi 6.
    
- **4096-QAM Modulation**: Wi-Fi 7 will introduce **4096-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)**, a higher-order modulation scheme that allows each symbol to carry 12 bits of data, compared to the 10 bits of 1024-QAM in Wi-Fi 6. This results in a 20% increase in data rate for the same coding rate.
    
- **Multi-RU Support**: Unlike Wi-Fi 6, where a user can only be assigned to a single Resource Unit (RU), Wi-Fi 7 will allow a single user to be assigned to multiple RUs. This provides more flexibility in spectrum resource scheduling and improves spectral efficiency.
    
- **Enhanced Preamble Design**: The preamble of a Wi-Fi frame, which contains critical information for synchronization and channel estimation, is being redesigned in Wi-Fi 7 to be more efficient and backward-compatible with legacy devices in the 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz bands. The new preamble will also support features like preamble puncturing for single-user transmissions, which was not possible in Wi-Fi 6.
