**Definition:**  
The time taken for a packet to travel from a station (STA) to the access point (AP).

**How It Works:**

- Composed of **channel access delay + transmission time + propagation delay + acknowledgment time**.
    
- In Wi-Fi 7 MLO, uplink delay depends on:
    
    - The **selected link** (primary or secondary).
        
    - **Contention level** and **backoff timers**.
        
    - Whether **synchronous** or **asynchronous transmission** is used.
        
- Measured as a key indicator of real-time performance.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Reducing uplink delay is critical for **uplink-heavy XR**, **IoT sensors**, and **cloud gaming**.
    
- Enhanced scheduling (QUC) and TSN support help mitigate uplink latency.
