**Definition:**  
The probability that a packet’s **end-to-end delay exceeds a target threshold** (e.g., 10 ms).

**How It Works:**

- Used in **QoS and latency-sensitive applications** to measure reliability.
    
- In MLO systems, DVP helps evaluate how well link selection, contention, and retransmission strategies maintain timing guarantees.
    
- Influenced by factors such as **channel congestion**, **backoff delay**, and **HARQ retransmissions**.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Crucial for **real-time services** (e.g., AR/VR, telepresence).
    
- Lower DVP means a more stable and predictable user experience.
