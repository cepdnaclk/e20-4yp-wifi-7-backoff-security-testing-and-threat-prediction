**Definition:**  
CSI refers to the **detailed characterization of the wireless channel** between transmitter and receiver.

**How It Works in Wi-Fi 7:**

- CSI is vital for **beamforming**, **link adaptation**, and **multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)**.
    
- In Wi-Fi 7, with **multi-link and multi-user environments**, each link and antenna group needs separate CSI feedback.
    
- This leads to **increased control overhead** — more time and bandwidth are spent collecting, transmitting, and updating CSI.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- While accurate CSI boosts throughput and reliability, its overhead can cause **latency and inefficiency**, especially in dynamic environments.
    
- Research focuses on **compressed CSI feedback**, **predictive CSI**, or **AI-based estimation** to reduce this burden.
