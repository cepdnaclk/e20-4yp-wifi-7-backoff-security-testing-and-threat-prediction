**Definition:**  
These are **MAC-layer mechanisms** that coordinate **multiple radios/links operating simultaneously** in Wi-Fi 7.

**How It Works:**

- **Synchronous mode:** all links of a Multi-Link Device (MLD) are **time-aligned** — they transmit/receive at the same time.
    
- The MAC protocol coordinates frame aggregation, scheduling, and acknowledgement across links.
    
- Contrast with **asynchronous MLO**, where each link acts more independently.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Synchronous operation minimizes idle time and improves latency determinism.
    
- Enables features like **aggregated throughput** and **joint scheduling** across multiple bands.
