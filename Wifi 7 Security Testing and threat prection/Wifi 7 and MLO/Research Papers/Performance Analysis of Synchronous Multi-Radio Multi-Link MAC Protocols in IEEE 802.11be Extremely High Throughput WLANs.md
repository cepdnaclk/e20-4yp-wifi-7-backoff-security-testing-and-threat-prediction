#### Summary

This paper analyzes synchronous multi-radio multi-link MAC protocols in IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) for Extremely High Throughput (EHT) WLANs. It reviews Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) adaptations for multi-link operation and uses a Markov chain model to evaluate performance. The focus is on pros/cons of candidate protocols, emphasizing throughput gains and latency reductions for apps like mobile gaming/VR. It discusses the evolution from single-link DCF to multi-link in Wi-Fi 7.

#### Important Points

- IEEE 802.11be targets max throughput >30 Gbps and improved latency.
- Multi-link operation enables simultaneous use of multiple links for EHT.
- DCF (CSMA/CA with binary exponential backoff) must adapt for multi-link.
- Analyzes synchronous multi-radio multi-link MAC protocols using Markov chain.
- Summarizes pros/cons of protocols and key findings.
- Wi-Fi 7's release framework impacts technology and market.
- Throughput analysis based on simple Markov chain for DCF.
