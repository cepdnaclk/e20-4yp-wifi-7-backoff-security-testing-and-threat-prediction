"Wi-Fi 7: New Challenges and Opportunities"**

This article focuses on the new challenges and opportunities presented by **IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)**, framing it as a necessary evolution to handle the stringent requirements of applications like 4k/8k video, AR/VR, and online gaming. It provides a detailed survey of the key physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer techniques under discussion.

#### Key Features and Enhancements:

- **PHY Layer Innovations**:
    
    - **Channelization and Tone Plan**: [[Channelization and Tone Plan]]The paper discusses the new designs for utilizing channel widths up to 320 MHz and how spectrum resources (resource units or RUs) are allocated.
        
    - **Multi-RU Support**: [[Multi-RU Support]]A significant improvement over Wi-Fi 6 is the ability to assign multiple RUs to a single user, which provides greater flexibility in scheduling and improves spectrum efficiency.
        
    - **4096-QAM**: [[4096-QAM Modulation]] Confirms the move to this higher-order modulation for a 20% data rate boost over Wi-Fi 6.
        
    - **Enhanced Preamble Design**: The preamble (the initial part of a Wi-Fi frame) is being redesigned to be more efficient and backward-compatible, especially for transmissions in the crowded 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz bands.
        
- **MAC Layer Innovations**:
    
    - **Multi-Link Operations (MLO)**: [[MLO]] This paper details the MAC-level implications of MLO, including how devices will manage aggregation and access across multiple channels simultaneously to boost speed and reliability.
        
    - **MIMO Enhancements**: [[Multi-User OFDMA & MU-MIMO Enhancements]] Discusses the move to 16 spatial streams and the challenges of managing CSI feedback. It explores more advanced and efficient feedback mechanisms to reduce overhead.
        
    - **Multi-AP Coordination**: [[Multi-AP Coordination]] Provides an in-depth look at the MAC protocols required for coordinated scheduling and transmission among multiple APs, a key feature for improving performance in dense Wi-Fi environments.
        

#### Opportunities and Future Directions:

The paper concludes by exploring opportunities for future research, such as leveraging machine learning for better resource management and Quality of Service (QoS), ensuring coexistence with other wireless technologies in the 6 GHz band, and developing more sophisticated power-saving mechanisms for Wi-Fi 7 devices.
