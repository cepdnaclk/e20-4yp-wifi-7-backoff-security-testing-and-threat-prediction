This paper is a general overview of **Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be)**. It starts with a history of Wi-Fi standards to show how much the technology has advanced. It then covers the main new technologies in Wi-Fi 7, what it could be used for, the challenges in adopting it, and its potential economic impact. The goal is to give a complete picture of Wi-Fi 7's capabilities.

#### **New Terminologies**

- **Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be):** The newest Wi-Fi standard, designed for big improvements in speed, capacity, and efficiency.
    
- **4096-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):** A more advanced modulation method that packs more data into the same radio wave, leading to faster speeds.
    
- **MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output):** A technology using multiple antennas to send and receive more data at once. First introduced in 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4).
    
- **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access):** A technology that lets a Wi-Fi access point talk to many devices at the same time by splitting a channel into smaller pieces.
    

#### **Technology Explanations**

- **Multi-Link Operation (MLO):** As in the first paper, this allows devices to use the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands simultaneously to increase speed and reliability.
    
- **320 MHz Channels:** Wi-Fi 7 doubles the maximum channel width to 320 MHz, which can double the data speed compared to Wi-Fi 6.
    
- **Preamble Puncturing:** This lets a Wi-Fi 7 device use only a part of a channel if another part is busy. This makes the Wi-Fi network much more efficient.
