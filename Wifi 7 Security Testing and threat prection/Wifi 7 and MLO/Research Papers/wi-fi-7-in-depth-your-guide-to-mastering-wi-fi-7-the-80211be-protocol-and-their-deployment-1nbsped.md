### **`wi-fi-7-in-depth-your-guide-to-mastering-wi-fi-7...pdf`**

#### **Summary**

This file is a comprehensive textbook titled **"Wi-Fi 7 In Depth."** It is not a single research paper but a complete guide for professionals to understand and deploy the 802.11be protocol. It covers the entire standard, starting from its foundations in Wi-Fi 6 (OFDMA, TWT) and then doing a "deep dive" into the new Physical (PHY) layer and MAC (Media Access Control) layer enhancements that define Wi-Fi 7.

The book's main focus is on the groundbreaking MAC features, especially **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**. It details MLO architecture, the different MLO modes, and how devices discover, associate, and manage these new multi-link connections. It also covers other key features like 320 MHz channels, 4096-QAM, and channel "puncturing." Finally, it discusses deployment considerations and even looks ahead to the next generation, Wi-Fi 8.

#### **Important Points & Pointers**

- **Comprehensive Guide:** This is an A-to-Z textbook on Wi-Fi 7, written by industry experts.
    
- **Builds on Wi-Fi 6:** It explains how Wi-Fi 7 evolves features from Wi-Fi 6, such as OFDMA, TWT (Target Wake Time), and BSS Coloring.
    
- **PHY Enhancements:** It details the new physical layer features responsible for the raw speed increase:
    
    - **320 MHz Channels:** Doubling the maximum channel width of Wi-Fi 6.
        
    - **4096-QAM:** A more complex modulation that packs more data into the signal.
        
- **MLO Deep Dive:** The book dedicates significant time to MLO, covering:
    
    - MLO Architecture (how MLDs are built).
        
    - MLD Discovery and Association (how they connect).
        
    - The **five possible MLO modes** (which dramatically affect performance).
        
    - ML Reconfiguration and Link Management.
        
- **Other Key Features:** It also explains other critical Wi-Fi 7 features like **Puncturing** (to avoid interference) and **Triggered Uplink Access** (for better upload performance).
    
- **Future-Looking:** The book concludes with chapters on network design, deployment, and a preview of **Wi-Fi 8** (e.g., features for sensing, localization, and better Multi-AP coordination).
    

#### **New Terms & Technologies**

- **EHT (Extremely High Throughput):** The official name for the IEEE 802.11be amendment (just as 802.11ax was "High Efficiency" or HE).
    
- **320 MHz Channels:** The new maximum channel width, enabling multi-gigabit speeds.
    
- **4096-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):** A denser modulation scheme that packs 12 bits of data per symbol, a 20% increase over Wi-Fi 6's 1024-QAM (10 bits).
    
- **MLD (Multi-Link Device):** The official term for a Wi-Fi 7 device (client or AP) that is capable of Multi-Link Operation.
    
- **MLO Modes:** The book details the different MLO operating modes, which include **MLSR (Multi-Link Single Radio)**, **eMLSR (Enhanced MLSR)**, and **MLMR (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)**, and their security/performance trade-offs.
    
- **Puncturing (or Preamble Puncturing):** A crucial feature that allows a Wi-Fi 7 AP to "puncture" (block off) a 20 or 40 MHz section of its wide 160 or 320 MHz channel if it detects interference. This allows it to use the remaining "clean" parts of the channel instead of falling back to a much narrower channel, thus improving efficiency.
    
- **Multi-AP Coordination (MAPC):** A set of features where multiple APs coordinate their transmissions to reduce interference and improve performance (a topic for Wi-Fi 7 and 8).
    
- **Wi-Fi 8 (IEEE 802.11bn):** The _next_ generation after Wi-Fi 7, which is already in the early planning stages.
