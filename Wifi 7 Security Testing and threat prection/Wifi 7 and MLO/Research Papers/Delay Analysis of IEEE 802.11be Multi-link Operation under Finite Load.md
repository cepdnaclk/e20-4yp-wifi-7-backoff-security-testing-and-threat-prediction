This research analyzes the **latency (delay)** performance of MLO in Wi-Fi 7 networks, but under more realistic "finite load" conditions (i.e., the network isn't constantly saturated with data). The paper specifically examines the **Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STR) Multi-Link Multi-Radio (MLMR)** implementation, which is the most flexible and potentially highest-performing version of MLO.

The study finds that MLO is very effective at controlling the **95th percentile delay**—a measure of the worst-case delay—especially as the amount of traffic in the network increases. This makes it a promising technology for delay-sensitive applications like cloud gaming and real-time video streaming.

However, the analysis also reveals that there are diminishing returns to adding more radio interfaces. While moving from a single link to two links provides a significant improvement, the benefit of adding a third or fourth link is progressively smaller because the probability of a packet having to wait in a buffer decreases rapidly with each added link. The paper validates its theoretical model with experiments using real-world traffic traces from the Google Stadia cloud gaming service.
