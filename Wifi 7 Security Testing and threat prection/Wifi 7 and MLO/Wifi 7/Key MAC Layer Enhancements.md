The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is also seeing significant improvements to manage the new capabilities of the PHY layer and to enhance overall network performance.

- **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**: One of the most significant innovations in Wi-Fi 7 is **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**. MLO allows a single device to transmit and receive data simultaneously across multiple frequency bands (2.4, 5, and 6 GHz) and channels. This can be used for load balancing, increasing throughput, and improving reliability by quickly retransmitting failed packets on an alternate link.
    
- **Multi-AP Coordination**: Wi-Fi 7 introduces several techniques for coordination between multiple Access Points (APs), a feature not present in previous Wi-Fi standards. These techniques include:
    
    - **Coordinated Spatial Reuse (CSR)**: APs coordinate to reduce interference and improve spatial reuse.
        
    - **Coordinated OFDMA (C-OFDMA)**: APs coordinate their OFDMA transmissions to avoid collisions and improve efficiency.
        
    - **Coordinated Beamforming (CBF)**: Multiple APs work together to form a focused beam of radio energy towards a client device, improving signal strength and reducing interference.
        
    - **Joint Transmission (JXT)**: Multiple APs transmit the same data to a client simultaneously, improving reliability and coverage.
        
- **MIMO Enhancements**: Wi-Fi 7 will increase the number of supported spatial streams from 8 in Wi-Fi 6 to **16**, further boosting network capacity. However, this also increases the overhead of acquiring Channel State Information (CSI), so new and more efficient CSI feedback mechanisms are being developed.
    
- **Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)**: To improve reliability and reduce latency, Wi-Fi 7 is expected to implement **Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)**. Unlike the standard ARQ protocol which discards erroneous packets, HARQ allows the receiver to store incorrectly decoded packets and combine them with subsequent retransmissions, increasing the probability of successful decoding.
