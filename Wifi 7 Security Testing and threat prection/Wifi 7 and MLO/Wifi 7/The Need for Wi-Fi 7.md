The emergence of high-throughput, low-latency applications such as 4k/8k video, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and online gaming has pushed the limits of the current Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax) standard. To meet the demands of these applications, the IEEE 802.11 working group has initiated the development of IEEE 802.11be, or Wi-Fi 7, which aims to achieve a maximum throughput of at least 30 Gbps.
