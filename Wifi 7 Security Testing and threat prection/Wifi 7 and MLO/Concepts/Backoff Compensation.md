Wi-Fi 7 and Backoff Compensation

Wi-Fi 7 introduces **multi-link operation (MLO)** and **enhanced channel access**, which complicate backoff.

**Problem:**

- With multiple links (e.g., 2.4 GHz + 5 GHz + 6 GHz used simultaneously), each link might have a **different backoff timer** running.
    
- If one link becomes free earlier, the other links may waste time still counting down.
    
- This reduces efficiency.
    

**Solution – Backoff Compensation:**

- Wi-Fi 7 introduces **synchronized backoff across links**.
    
- If one link finishes its backoff earlier, the others **adjust (compensate) their timers** so they can transmit together.
    
- This ensures multi-link devices can start transmissions simultaneously, improving throughput and lowering latency.

### 🔑 How Backoff Compensation Works in Wi-Fi 7

1. **Maintain a shared backoff counter** across all active links.
    
2. **When a transmission opportunity arises** on one link, the other links "compensate" their counters so they don’t have to restart from scratch.
    
3. This enables **parallel channel usage** (multi-link synchronous transmissions).
    
4. The result: **better channel utilization, lower delay, and higher aggregate throughput.**

**In short:**  
Backoff compensation in Wi-Fi 7 = **a mechanism to synchronize and reuse backoff timers across multiple links** so that multi-link operation is efficient and doesn’t waste airtime.
