## **Multi-User OFDMA & MU-MIMO Enhancements**

### **What it is:**

- **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access):** Divides channels into subcarriers for multiple users.
    
- **MU-MIMO (Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output):** Allows multiple antennas to communicate with multiple devices at once.
    

### **How it works:**

- Wi-Fi 7 supports **more simultaneous users** and **more spatial streams**.
    
- Subcarriers can be dynamically assigned based on device demand.
    

### **Pros:**

- **Efficient spectrum utilization** in dense environments.
    
- Supports **more concurrent devices** without slowing down.
    

### **Cons:**

- Requires **advanced coordination and hardware support**.
    
- Slightly increased **device complexity and power consumption**.
    

### **Use cases:**

- Stadiums, airports, smart factories.
    
- Multi-device homes with IoT, streaming, and gaming simultaneously.
