### 🧠 **1. WiTwin (Wireless Digital Twin)**

**Definition:**  
WiTwin is a **centralized digital twin architecture** designed to enhance Wi-Fi 7 network performance, especially for mobile devices (STAs) with **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**.

**Purpose:**

- To maintain **reliable, low-latency communication** during mobility (e.g., for AGVs, AMRs).
    
- To perform **intelligent, predictive roaming** by continuously modeling and analyzing the radio environment.
    

**How it works:**

- Collects real-time data from APs and STAs (e.g., signal strength, frame delivery ratio, position).
    
- Builds and updates a **WiTwinModel** (a spatial heatmap) that predicts channel quality across locations and channels.
    
- Uses this model to **proactively decide when and where to roam** for optimal connectivity.
    

**Key advantages:**

- Minimizes communication gaps during movement.
    
- Enables **network-driven** (rather than device-driven) roaming.
    
- Supports **predictive and adaptive** wireless control through data-driven modeling.
