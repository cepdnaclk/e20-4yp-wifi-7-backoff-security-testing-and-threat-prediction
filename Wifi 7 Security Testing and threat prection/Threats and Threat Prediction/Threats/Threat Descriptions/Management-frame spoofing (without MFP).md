**What it is:** forging management frames (beacon, probe, auth, deauth) to influence client/AP behavior.  
**Impact:** can enable DoS, rogue AP creation, redirecting clients, or denial of service.  
**Indicators:** forged frames observed in captures, inconsistent frame sources.  
**Mitigation:** enable 802.11w/MFP (Management Frame Protection), monitor management frame anomalies.
