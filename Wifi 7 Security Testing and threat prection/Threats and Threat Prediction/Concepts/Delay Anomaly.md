**Definition:**  
A condition where packets experience **unexpectedly high or inconsistent delay**, even under moderate load.

**How It Works in Wi-Fi 7:**

- Occurs when one or more MLO links become congested, while others remain idle — poor scheduling or link imbalance.
    
- Could result from **unfair contention**, **backoff asymmetry**, or **channel switching delays**.
    
- May also arise due to **cross-link interference** or **CSI acquisition delays**.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Leads to degraded **QoE** and violates **delay guarantees** for time-sensitive applications.
    
- Advanced MLO schedulers and TSN-based coordination aim to **minimize delay anomalies**.
