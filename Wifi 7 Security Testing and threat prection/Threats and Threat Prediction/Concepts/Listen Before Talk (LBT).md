**Definition:**  
A **regulatory and coexistence mechanism** requiring devices to sense the channel before transmitting.

**How It Works:**

- The station measures **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)** levels.
    
- If energy detected < threshold → transmit.
    
- If energy detected ≥ threshold → defer and backoff.
    
- Mandatory in **unlicensed bands** (especially 6 GHz) to ensure **fair coexistence** with other technologies (e.g., 5G NR-U).
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Prevents interference and improves spectrum fairness.
    
- Essential for **cross-technology coexistence** between Wi-Fi 7 and 5G.
