- **Summary:** This article presents a historical overview of Wi-Fi technology, from its 1971 origins in ALOHAnet to modern standards. It is intended as an educational resource. The paper's main focus is the evolution of Wi-Fi security protocols, detailing the creation, shortcomings, and replacement of WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.
    
- **Important Points:**
    
    - Provides a history of Wi-Fi development and its security protocols.
        
    - Discusses the strengths and weaknesses of WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.
        
- **New Technologies, Findings, and Relevance to Wi-Fi 7 Security:**
    
    - **New Technologies:** The most recent technology analyzed is **WPA3**.
        
    - **Relevance to Context:** This paper provides essential background. **Wi-Fi 7 mandates WPA3**. Therefore, all security testing for Wi-Fi 7 is built on the foundation of its WPA3 implementation.
        
    - **Security Testing:** This paper informs **security testing** by explaining the vulnerabilities (in WEP, WPA, WPA2) that WPA3 was designed to fix. A key testing strategy for Wi-Fi 7 would be to attempt **downgrade attacks**, trying to force a Wi-Fi 7 access point and client to negotiate a connection using the older, vulnerable WPA2 protocol.
