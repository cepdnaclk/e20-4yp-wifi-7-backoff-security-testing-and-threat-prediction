- **Summary:** This paper provides a critical examination of Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be), acknowledging its transformative potential for high-speed, low-latency applications while focusing on its inherent limitations. The research centers on the primary technical and security challenges, specifically spectrum management in congested unlicensed bands, interference with legacy protocols, and significant privacy risks. It analyzes the new security vulnerabilities introduced by Wi-Fi 7's core features.
    
- **Important Points:**
    
    - Wi-Fi 7 promises unprecedented speeds and low latency for applications like augmented reality and cloud gaming.
        
    - The paper's main focus is on the challenges, not just the benefits, including spectrum congestion, interference, and security.
        
    - It highlights the difficulty of Wi-Fi 7 coexisting with older Wi-Fi protocols and 5G NR-U.
        
    - The paper discusses privacy risks associated with Wi-Fi 7 data collection.
        
- **New Technologies, Findings, and Relevance to Wi-Fi 7 Security:**
    
    - **New Technologies:** The paper is directly about **Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be)** and its new features, such as **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)** and 320 MHz channels.
        
    - **New Findings/Threat Prediction:** This paper is highly relevant as it explicitly links Wi-Fi 7's new features to new security vulnerabilities. It references a "Risk Assessment Framework" for these challenges and details the security implications of MLO. This provides a direct foundation for **threat prediction** by identifying the new attack surfaces.
        
    - **Security Testing:** This paper strongly suggests that **security testing** for Wi-Fi 7 must focus on MLO, spectrum-sharing mechanisms, and data privacy, as these are identified as primary areas of risk.
