## Task Group be (TGbe)

- **What it is:** The formal name for the IEEE working group (a "Task Group") that was responsible for creating the **802.11be** technical standard.
    
- **How it works:** "Wi-Fi 7" is the marketing name from the Wi-Fi Alliance. "IEEE 802.11be" is the official technical specification. TGbe was the committee of engineers who debated, wrote, and ratified all the features (MLO, 320 MHz channels, etc.).
    
- **Security Relevance:** This is not a technology itself, but the _source_ of the technology. Any ambiguities, oversights, or logical flaws in the specification written by TGbe can lead to security vulnerabilities that get "baked into" the hardware and software of all Wi-Fi 7 products.
