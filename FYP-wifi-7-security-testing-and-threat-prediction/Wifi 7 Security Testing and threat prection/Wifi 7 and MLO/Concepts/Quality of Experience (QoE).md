**Definition:**  
A **user-centric measure** of network performance — how the user perceives service quality (not just throughput).

**How It Works:**

- Derived from **QoS metrics** (delay, jitter, packet loss, throughput).
    
- Wi-Fi 7 optimizes QoE through:
    
    - Adaptive MLO scheduling (using QUC).
        
    - Delay and jitter reduction via **TSN alignment**.
        
    - Dynamic rate control and link steering.
        

**Why It Matters:**

- Ensures high satisfaction for **latency-sensitive** and **immersive** applications (AR/VR, streaming, gaming).
    
- More holistic than network-level QoS metrics.
