**Definition:**  
The **fundamental building block** of an IEEE 802.11 network — consisting of one AP and all associated stations (STAs).

**How It Works:**

- Each BSS operates on a **specific channel** and has a **unique BSSID (MAC address)**.
    
- Wi-Fi 7 introduces **multi-BSSID coordination** and **multi-link BSSs**, allowing a device to belong to multiple BSSs across bands.
    
- BSS coloring (introduced in Wi-Fi 6) is used to differentiate overlapping networks — still relevant in 7.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Key to managing **multi-band and multi-AP coordination**.
    
- Efficient BSS management improves spectrum reuse and coexistence.
