When people talk about **MLO exploitation** in Wi-Fi 7, they usually mean looking at the **potential vulnerabilities or attack surfaces** that arise from **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**. Since MLO is new in 802.11be, it brings both **huge performance benefits** and **new risks**.

## ⚡ What Could Be Exploited in MLO?

### 1. **Backoff Manipulation Attacks**

- Each link runs its own backoff (BO) process.
    
- In **synchronous mode**, backoff compensation is used to align counters.
    
- A malicious device could deliberately **misreport or desynchronize backoff states**, causing:
    
    - unfair channel access,
        
    - forcing legitimate devices to wait longer,
        
    - denial-of-service (DoS).

### 2. **Cross-Link Interference Exploitation**

- RF **power leakage** or crosstalk between links can confuse channel sensing (CCA).
    
- An attacker could generate **spurious signals on one band** to block multi-link transmission altogether, reducing throughput.
    

---

### 3. **Frame Aggregation & Striping Risks**

- In synchronous MLO, a single higher-layer frame can be **striped across multiple bands**.
    
- If one link is jammed or interfered with, the **entire aggregated transmission fails**.
    
- Attackers can exploit this by selectively targeting just one link.
    

---

### 4. **Multi-Link Association Hijacking**

- MLO introduces a new **multi-link association process** (a device sets up multiple links in one association).
    
- Weaknesses in authentication/management frames could be exploited for:
    
    - session hijacking,
        
    - link teardown attacks,
        
    - replay attacks across links.
        

---

### 5. **Resource Allocation Exploitation**

- Wi-Fi 7 APs must coordinate resource units (RUs), channels, and scheduling across multiple bands.
    
- A rogue client could **flood scheduling requests** or **abuse MLO QoS rules**, starving other clients.
    

---

## 🛡️ Mitigations Being Considered

- Stronger **per-link authentication and integrity checks** (802.11be improves on 802.11ax here).
    
- **Cross-link consistency checks** → AP verifies that all links in an MLD behave properly.
    
- **Adaptive scheduling** to detect and throttle misbehaving clients.
    
- **Better PHY-layer isolation** to limit RF leakage exploitation.

✅ **In short:**  
MLO exploitation = taking advantage of the **new coordination mechanisms** (backoff alignment, multi-link association, frame striping, etc.) to cause **unfair access, DoS, or security breaches**.
