**Definition:**  
ESCA is a proposed **enhancement to spatial channel access schemes** that allows multiple radios or links to coordinate transmissions spatially rather than just temporally.

**How It Works:**

- Traditional channel access focuses on **time division** (who transmits when).
    
- ESCA introduces **spatial coordination**, allowing different links to use **different spatial resources** (antennas or beams) simultaneously.
    
- This is vital for **Synchronous MLO** where multi-radio stations operate concurrently.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Improves spectrum efficiency and reduces idle periods.
    
- Allows Wi-Fi 7 devices to exploit spatial diversity without excessive collisions.
