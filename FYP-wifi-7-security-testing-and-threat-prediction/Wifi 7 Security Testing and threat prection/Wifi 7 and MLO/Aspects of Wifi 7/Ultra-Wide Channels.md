## **Ultra-Wide Channels (320 MHz)**

### **What it is:**

- Traditional Wi-Fi 6 uses **up to 160 MHz channels**. Wi-Fi 7 doubles this to **320 MHz**.
    
- A **channel** is a slice of spectrum used to transmit data; wider channels can carry more data simultaneously.
    

### **How it works:**

- Wi-Fi 7 can aggregate multiple **contiguous 160 MHz channels** or use one single **320 MHz channel**.
    
- Wider channels allow **more subcarriers in OFDMA** → more data transmitted per unit time.
    

### **Pros:**

- **Higher throughput:** Theoretically up to **46 Gbps** across all bands (when combined with MLO).
    
- **Better performance for high-bandwidth applications:** 8K video streaming, VR/AR, cloud gaming.
    

### **Cons:**

- **Requires high-quality spectrum:** Interference is more likely in crowded environments.
    
- **Shorter effective range:** Wider channels are more sensitive to signal degradation over distance.
    
- **Limited availability in lower bands (2.4 GHz)**.
    

### **Use cases:**

- Data centers and enterprise networks.
    
- Ultra-HD streaming in dense urban environments.
    
- VR/AR and cloud gaming with low latency.
