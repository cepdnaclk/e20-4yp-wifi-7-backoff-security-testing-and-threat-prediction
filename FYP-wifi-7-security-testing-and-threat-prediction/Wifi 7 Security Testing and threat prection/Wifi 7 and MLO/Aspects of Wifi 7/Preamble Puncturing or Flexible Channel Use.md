## **Preamble Puncturing / Flexible Channel Use**

### **What it is:**

- Ability to **skip parts of a channel** if occupied or noisy.
    
- Uses remaining clean spectrum to maintain throughput.
    

### **How it works:**

- AP can “puncture” (ignore) **contaminated parts of a channel**.
    
- Data continues over **remaining subchannels** without full retransmission.
    

### **Pros:**

- **Improved resilience to interference.**
    
- Maintains high throughput even in crowded spectrum.
    

### **Cons:**

- Slightly more **complex signal processing**.
    
- Maximum throughput may be reduced if large parts of the channel are punctured.
    

### **Use cases:**

- Dense urban Wi-Fi networks.
    
- Environments with overlapping legacy Wi-Fi signals.
