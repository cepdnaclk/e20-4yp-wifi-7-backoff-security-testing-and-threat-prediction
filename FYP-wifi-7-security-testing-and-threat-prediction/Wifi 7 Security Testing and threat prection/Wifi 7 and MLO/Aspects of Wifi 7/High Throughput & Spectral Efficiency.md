## **High Throughput & Spectral Efficiency**

- Wi-Fi 7 achieves **extremely high throughput** via a combination of:
    
    - **4096-QAM**
        
    - **320 MHz channels**
        
    - **MLO**
        
    - **MU-MIMO / OFDMA enhancements**
        
- Spectral efficiency increases by **using spectrum more intelligently**, even in dense environments.
    

**Use cases:**

- Multi-gigabit home internet.
    
- Cloud gaming, VR/AR, 8K streaming.
    
- Enterprise and industrial IoT networks
