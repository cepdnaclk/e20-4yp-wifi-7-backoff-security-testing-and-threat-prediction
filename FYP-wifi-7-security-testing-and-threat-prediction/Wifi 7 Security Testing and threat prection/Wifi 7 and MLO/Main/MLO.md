MLO stands for **Multi-Link Operation**, a key feature introduced in **Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be)**.

### 🔑 What it means:

- Traditionally, Wi-Fi devices operate over one link (one band/channel) at a time.
    
- With **MLO**, a device (like a router and client) can use **multiple frequency bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz)** **simultaneously** as a single aggregated connection.
    

### ⚙️ How it works:

- Think of it like "multi-lane highways": instead of sending all traffic through one lane (band), data packets can be split and transmitted across multiple lanes at once.
    
- The links can be:
    
    - **Synchronous (coordinated):** packets are scheduled and transmitted in parallel across bands.
        
    - **Asynchronous (independent):** each band can transmit packets separately, improving efficiency if one band has interference.
        

### ✅ Benefits of MLO:

1. **Higher throughput** – multiple bands at once increase effective bandwidth.
    
2. **Lower latency** – traffic can avoid congested links and use the best one.
    
3. **Better reliability** – if one band is noisy, others can still carry data.
    
4. **Improved load balancing** – smart scheduling optimizes link usage.
    

### 📌 Example:

If a Wi-Fi 7 phone supports MLO, it could connect to a router on both **5 GHz** and **6 GHz** at the same time, combining speeds and reducing lag for gaming or VR.
