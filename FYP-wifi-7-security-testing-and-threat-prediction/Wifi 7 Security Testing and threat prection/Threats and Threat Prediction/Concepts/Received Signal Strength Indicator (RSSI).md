**Definition:**  
A measure of **signal power level** received by a device, typically in dBm.

**How It Works:**

- The AP or STA measures RSSI to estimate **link quality**.
    
- Influences **rate adaptation**, **beamforming**, and **link selection** in MLO.
    
- Used in **LBT** to decide if the channel is idle.
    

**Why It Matters:**

- Accurate RSSI measurement helps maintain **robust connections** and reduce retransmissions.
    
- In multi-link devices, RSSI helps choose the best link dynamically.
