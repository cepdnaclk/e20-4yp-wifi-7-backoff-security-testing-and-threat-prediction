**What it is:** using a transmitter to overwhelm the channel with noise or signals, preventing normal communication. This is a physical attack, not a protocol-level exploit.  
**Impact:** total denial of service on affected channels.  
**Indicators:** persistent high noise floor, many failed associations, devices falling back to other bands.  
**Mitigation:** use spectrum analysis to detect jamming, relocate to other frequencies, regulatory enforcement; physical countermeasures.
