**What it is:** attacker floods the air with probe requests (wildcard or directed), causing APs/clients to spend resources replying or processing them.  
**Impact:** scanning noise, DoS-like effects, privacy exposure (clients revealing known SSIDs).  
**Indicators:** high rate of probe requests observed in spectrum capture.  
**Mitigation:** reduce client probe behavior (client-side settings), network anomaly detection, RF monitoring.
