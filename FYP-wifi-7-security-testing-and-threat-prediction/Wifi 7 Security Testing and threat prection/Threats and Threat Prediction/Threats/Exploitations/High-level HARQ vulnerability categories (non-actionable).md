## High-level HARQ vulnerability categories (non-actionable)

- **Feedback manipulation / spoofing** — falsified ACK/NACK signals can cause unnecessary retransmissions or premature clearing of HARQ state.
    
- **Retransmission amplification / flood** — artificially causing repeated retransmissions to waste airtime, increase delay, or exhaust retransmission budgets.
    
- **Buffer exhaustion / state exhaustion** — forcing or inducing large numbers of pending HARQ contexts so receiver/transmitter soft-buffers are stressed.
    
- **Timing desynchronization (cross-link)** — creating scenarios where HARQ combining across MLO links is impaired (e.g., excessive delay on one link), reducing soft-combining gains.
    
- **Incremental-redundancy disruption** — manipulating channel conditions so incremental redundancy is less effective (higher PER on retransmissions), reducing HARQ benefit.
    
- **QoS/priority abuse via HARQ** — triggering HARQ activity on high-priority flows to starve low-priority traffic or vice versa, upsetting airtime fairness.
    
- **Combined PHY+MAC attacks** — coordinated interference during HARQ feedback windows to maximize retransmission cost.

## Observable indicators (what defenders should monitor)

- **Unusual spike in NACKs or retransmission counts** for particular links, flows, or ACs.
    
- **Persistent high HARQ buffer occupancy / long soft-buffer dwell times.**
    
- **Discrepancy between PHY metrics and HARQ behaviour** (e.g., normal SNR but abnormally high retransmissions).
    
- **Cross-link asymmetry in MLO:** one link showing many HARQ events while others remain quiet.
    
- **Abrupt changes in throughput/jitter correlated with HARQ activity.**
    
- **Repeated, short-lived retransmission bursts** timed to certain control windows.

## Defensive mitigations & hardening (recommended, non-actionable)

- **Authenticate and integrity-protect control/feedback messages** (make ACK/NACKs and telemetry trustworthy).
    
- **Rate-limit and throttle retransmissions** per flow or per link; apply exponential backoff on repeated failures.
    
- **Bound HARQ buffer usage** and apply admission controls to avoid buffer exhaustion.
    
- **Cross-validation of reward/health signals**: corroborate HARQ feedback with PHY counters (SNR, PER), queue depths, and passive monitors.
    
- **Anomaly detection rules**: alert on NACK spikes, disproportionate retransmissions vs. expected PER, or coordinated HARQ events across STAs.
    
- **Graceful fallback policies**: if HARQ performance degrades, fall back to conservative ARQ/robust MCS and avoid aggressive multi-link combining until stabilized.
    
- **Secure scheduler design**: incorporate hysteresis, smoothing, and conservative decision thresholds so a few spurious HARQ events don’t cause wholesale reconfigurations.
    
- **Logging and forensics**: timestamped HARQ/PHY/MAC logs to analyze suspected manipulation patterns.

## How to study HARQ threats safely (for your digital-twin project)

- Use your **digital twin** to simulate HARQ behaviors, measure the impact of adverse conditions on retransmission rates and latency, and tune mitigations — without touching live networks.
    
- Evaluate **detection thresholds** by injecting controlled, benign anomalies in the twin (lab only) to calibrate false positive/negative tradeoffs.
    
- Test **robust bandit/RL** steering policies in the twin with adversarial-style noise to improve resilience.
