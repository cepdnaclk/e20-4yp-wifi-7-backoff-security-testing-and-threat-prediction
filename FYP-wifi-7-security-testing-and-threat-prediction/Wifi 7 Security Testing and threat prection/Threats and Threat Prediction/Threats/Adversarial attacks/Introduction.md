However the use of machine learning in wireless networks is a double-edged sword. While it can help optimise network operations, it is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These attacks can be classified into three categories:

- Exploratory (or inference) attacks – the adversary trains itself to understand or infer how the nodes in the network will behave based on the captured wireless data
- Evasion attacks – the adversary attempts to trick the network nodes into making mistakes in their decisions
- Poisoning (or causative) attacks – the adversary tampers with the network nodes’ learning process by injecting incorrect training data
