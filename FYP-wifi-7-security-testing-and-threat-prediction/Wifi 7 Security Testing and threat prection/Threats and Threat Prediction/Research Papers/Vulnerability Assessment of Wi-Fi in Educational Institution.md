- **Authors:** Rauha Alueendo, Nalina Suresh, Valerianus Hashiyana, and Emily Bagarukayo
    
- **Year:** 2020
    
- **Summary:** This paper is a systematic review of research on Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, threats, and security measures specifically within educational institutions. It discusses the high adoption of Wi-Fi in schools and universities, often in a "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) context , and the resulting cyber threats. The paper's goal is to consolidate existing knowledge on how these specific networks are assessed for security.
    
- **Important Points:**
    
    - The paper reviews Wi-Fi security in the specific context of educational institutions.
        
    - It highlights the security challenges that arise from high Wi-Fi adoption and BYOD policies.
        
- **New Technologies, Findings, and Relevance to Wi-Fi 7 Security:**
    
    - **New Technologies:** This paper discusses general Wi-Fi security and is not specific to any new technology.
        
    - **Relevance to Context:** This paper has **low relevance** to Wi-Fi 7 security testing. It is a general, environment-specific review from 2020 and does not contain information on Wi-Fi 7, WPA3, or advanced threats. It could only serve as a basic checklist for common, older Wi-Fi vulnerabilities.
